# Auto Fold Imports

Like the name implies, this extension automatically folds the ES6 imports of JavaScript and TypeScript files.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `auto-fold-imports.debug`: Print debug statements.
- `auto-fold-imports.minimumBlockSize`: How big an imports block needs to be before it's auto folded.
- `auto-fold-imports.extraLanguages`: Extra languages in which to auto folds.
